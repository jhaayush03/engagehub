            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              EngageHub was founded in 2014 with a simple yet powerful vision: to transform the way students approach education. 
              What started as a small tutoring center has grown into a comprehensive educational service provider, serving hundreds 
              of students across multiple grade levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our journey has been marked by countless success stories, from students who improved their grades significantly to 
              those who gained admission to their dream universities. Each success story reinforces our commitment to providing 
              exceptional educational services that make a real difference in students' lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we continue to innovate and expand our services, always keeping our core mission at heart: empowering students 
              to achieve their academic dreams through personalized, comprehensive support.
